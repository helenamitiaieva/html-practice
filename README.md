# My First HTML Project

This repository contains my very first HTML file — the project where I started learning how to write HTML code from scratch.

It was created as part of my early learning journey and includes basic HTML structure, common tags, and simple page layout practice.

## What I practiced

- HTML document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings, paragraphs, and text formatting
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Links and images
- Basic semantic elements

## Purpose of this repository

This project is important to me because it marks the beginning of my front-end development journey.
I keep it here to track my progress and to remember where I started.

## Next steps

In future projects, I plan to continue improving my skills by learning:
- CSS styling and layout
- Responsive design
- JavaScript basics
